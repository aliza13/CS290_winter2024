Due Monday 1/15

Assignment 1 (simple HTML and design):
In your GitHub repo, create a folder for assignment1 and a README file in that folder,
In your README file (feel free to include labeled drawings!) create a design for a web app that you would want to use, whether it be a game, an information service, a chat serviceâ€¦
Note: I do not expect us to make a good clean version of this app even by the time we finish final projects.

Create a simple webpage as a first attempt at creating structure for your web app design using at least the following HTML elements: doctype, html, head, body, meta, lang, title, headers (at least 3 from h1-h6), paragraphs (p), lists (ol, ul, dl), line breaks (br), anchor (a, a link to another page), relative path, absolute path, fragment identifier, image, video, width, height, alt, table, row, data cell, border, table caption, table header, table body, table footer, spanning columns

Remember to commit your changes to your repo regularly!
Submit a link to your repo to Moodle as a reminder to us to grade your work smile!
