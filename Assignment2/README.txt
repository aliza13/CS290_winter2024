Instructions for assignment 2

Assignment 2 (More HTML with CSS):

Again create a design for a web app that you would want to use!
*** add to my previous design but with CSS ideas
Note: This can be a redesigned version of your first design.  I expect more details in these designs as we move forward.

Create a simple webpage (HTML can be simple, but include enough to show off your CSS styles) that attempts to apply some style from your design to the HTML; be sure to include at least the following CSS properties: class attribute, class selector, id attribute, id selector, role attribute, attribute selectors, font family, font size, font style, font variant, font weight, font property shorthand, text align, text decoration, line height, color (in a few ways), border and shorthand, padding and shorthand, margin and shorthand.

Be sure to commit to your git repo regularly as you make your site,
Remember to double check that your repo is shared with the instructor!
Remember to submit a link to your git repo to Moodle to remind us to grade it!

Last note: remember that your site does not need to be pretty, we are experimenting with each of these elements, attributes, properties, and values to figure out how they work, you will have a chance to make nicer looking sites soon smile!
