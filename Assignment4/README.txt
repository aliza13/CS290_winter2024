Create yet another design for a web app that you would want to useâ€¦ is this getting any easier yet?

Create a webpage with enough elements and styles that allow you to show off some JavaScript capabilities and include at least the following JavaScript features: input (perhaps using an input element), output (maybe inside a <p> or in a fancier element), variables of a few datatypes (at least number, string, boolean, and a couple objects), show off some common errors and how you might avoid them, conditionals, repetition, arrays, functions, demonstrate scope, objects and events

Go find a JavaScript library that has some features that you think might be useful and be ready to discuss some of this with the class

https://react.dev/ build UI's web apps

Attempt to use that library to create another page that demonstrates some key features of the library (perhaps by going through a tutorial for that library?)
